To be able to actually do anything on the dapp, you need a Metmask Wallet and some Rinkeby eth.

If you do not have a metamask wallet, [here](https://www.surgewomen.io/learn-about-web3/set-up-metamask-wallet) is a guide you can follow on how to set up one.

To get some Rinkeby eth here are some available faucets you can request from:
